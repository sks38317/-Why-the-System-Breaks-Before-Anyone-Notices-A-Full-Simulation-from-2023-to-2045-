Technical Evaluation of the SSR Social Collapse Simulation Model

1. Validity of Variable Relationships and Formula Structure

Selection of Key Variables: The SSR model focuses on five core variables – Institutional Distrust (SIP), Food Shock (ΔF), Migration (M), Unemployment (U), and Conflict (C) – as drivers of societal instability and collapse. These choices are broadly justifiable, as each is well-documented in the literature as a contributor to social unrest or state fragility. For example, widespread food insecurity and price spikes are known to act as “threat multipliers” for conflict, often being the final stress that tips societies into unrest. In fact, an IMF study using machine learning found that food price inflation is among the key predictors of social unrest outbreaks. Likewise, high unemployment, especially among youth, has been identified as a significant risk factor for protests and rebellion – as seen in the Arab Spring where youth joblessness (~23–25%) was a major catalyst for uprisings. Erosion of institutional trust (captured by SIP) is also critical: when citizens lose faith in government or institutions, grievances mount and compliance with authority diminishes, creating fertile ground for unrest. Research has shown a two-way feedback between institutional effectiveness and public trust – a small shock that weakens government performance can rapidly erode trust and plunge a society into turmoil. The inclusion of Migration (displacement/refugees) and Conflict is similarly pertinent. Large-scale forced migration can strain host societies and exacerbate ethnic or resource tensions, sometimes destabilizing entire regions. Meanwhile, ongoing conflict (civil wars, insurgencies, etc.) directly undermines security and can push social systems toward collapse if unchecked. In summary, the five variables chosen align with known dimensions of social systemic risk (economic stress, resource scarcity, governance legitimacy, demographic pressures, and violence). This selection is reasonable and comprehensive in covering major drivers of social breakdown, with no glaring omissions of other primary factors noted in collapse literature (such as one might add inequality or climate change, though the latter is indirectly represented through food shocks).

Formula Structure and Weights: The SSR report defines risk formulae for “Social Unrest” and “Systemic Collapse” based on these variables. Without the exact equations, we infer that the model likely uses a weighted combination of the five variables to compute a composite risk score (the “Social Systemic Risk” index). A critical evaluation point is whether the weighting of variables and the functional form are well-founded. If the model simply sums each factor with fixed weights, it assumes linear, independent contributions of each variable to overall risk. This is a coarse simplification – in reality these factors interact in complex, non-linear ways. For instance, institutional distrust (SIP) can amplify the impact of unemployment on unrest: when trust in government is low, economic hardship is more likely to spark protests or violence than in a high-trust society. Such interaction effects (cross-terms) do not appear explicitly in the SSR formulas, which means the model might be missing important synergies or feedback loops. The absence of interaction terms could underestimate risk in scenarios where multiple stressors coincide. Research on global crises emphasizes that catastrophe often strikes when multiple stresses combine, not in isolation: *“A global crisis arises when one or more fast-moving trigger events combine with slow-moving stresses to push a system out of its equilibrium.”*. The linear structure of the SSR model may fail to capture this emergent risk from compound pressures, an aspect to scrutinize in its design.

Additionally, the basis for the chosen weights in the risk equations should be examined. Are they derived from empirical data (e.g. regression coefficients from historical instances of unrest) or simply set by expert judgment? If the report does not justify the weighting scheme, it raises questions of subjectivity. For credibility, one would expect the model’s weights to align with evidence – for example, prior IMF research found that recent unrest history and food inflation have outsized impact on unrest probability, suggesting higher weights for ΔF and conflict variables in triggering social unrest. Without transparent rationale or calibration, the weight assignments in SSR could be seen as arbitrary. Moreover, the model seems to treat each year’s risk as a function of that year’s conditions alone, without path-dependence. This ignores dynamic momentum in social systems – empirically, if a country experienced unrest recently, its future risk is elevated (the probability of unrest quadruples if there was an event in the past 6 months). The SSR model, as described, does not indicate incorporating such temporal feedback (e.g. unrest leading to further distrust and conflict, creating a vicious cycle). This is a limitation of the formula structure in capturing self-reinforcing loops. Indeed, studies have modeled how a breakdown of trust and institutional effectiveness can become self-fulfilling and lead to multiple equilibria (either stable or chaos). The SSR’s straightforward equations likely cannot reproduce these tipping-point dynamics, meaning it may underplay the possibility of abrupt shifts (sudden collapse) versus gradual change.

Overall, the model’s framework is a plausible first-order approach – it identifies key risk factors and attempts to quantify a systemic risk index. However, its validity rests on how well it justifies those factors’ inclusion and interaction. The absence of explicit interaction terms and feedback mechanisms is a notable weakness; real societal collapse scenarios usually involve complex interdependencies (for example, food shortages fueling conflict, or conflict further disrupting food supply, in a reinforcing spiral). If SSR treats each driver in isolation, it might underestimate compounded systemic risk in extreme conditions. Future refinement could involve introducing interaction variables (such as Conflict × FoodShock to reflect how food crises in a conflict-prone society could ignite unrest much more than either factor alone). It would also be beneficial if the model explained its weighting choices in light of literature or data – for instance, why “Institutional Distrust” might be weighted say 20% of the SSR index versus, say, 30% for “Conflict”. In evidence-based risk indices (like the Fragile States Index or similar composite measures), weights are often derived from expert surveys or statistical analyses. Lacking such grounding, the SSR formula’s structure may be seen as somewhat ad-hoc, which could undermine confidence in its quantitative outputs even if qualitatively the components make sense.

2. Persuasiveness of Scenario Assumptions

Scenario Design: The report outlines two divergent scenarios for the 2023–2045 period: Scenario 1 – “Status Quo (현실 유지)” and Scenario 2 – “Compound Crisis (복합 위기)”. This dual-scenario setup is a classic exploratory approach, bracketing a baseline future and a severe downside future. In Scenario 1, the model presumably keeps variables within the realm of historical norms or trends – institutional trust might gradually decline at the current rate, food systems face challenges but no catastrophic failures, migration flows follow existing forecasts, unemployment varies with normal business cycles, and conflicts remain localized/minor. Essentially, it is a continuation of “business as usual” without any unprecedented shocks. Scenario 2, by contrast, posits a convergence of multiple crises that dramatically worsen the five variables. This could include, for example: a series of climate-induced food supply shocks (e.g. repeated crop failures causing global price spikes), leading to spikes in ΔF; more frequent and severe conflicts (perhaps new wars or expansion of current ones) pushing the conflict index C high; large-scale migration surges as refugees flee climate disasters or violence (raising M considerably); economic turbulence or depression-level events driving unemployment (U) to extreme levels; and political upheavals or corruption scandals that erode institutional trust (SIP) to new lows. The scenario seems akin to a “polycrisis” narrative, where several risk factors reinforce each other. Such a scenario is structurally plausible and in line with foresight exercises by experts – for example, the World Economic Forum and other think-tanks have warned of a future where “the world faces multiple, mounting crises” by 2040, including climate instability, economic stagnation, and geopolitical fragmentation, all compounding to undermine global stability. The SSR’s Scenario 2 directly mirrors this idea of a cascading, interconnected crisis environment.

Differentiation of Variables and Shocks: The credibility of the scenarios depends on how well the report differentiated the trajectories of each variable under the two scenarios. A persuasive design would not simply increase all risk drivers uniformly in Scenario 2, but logically link them to specific crisis storylines. For example, Scenario 2 might involve an external shock like a massive crop blight or climate event in the late 2020s that causes ΔF (Food Shock) to spike sharply (representing global grain shortages). This in turn could lead to rising conflict in affected regions (food riots, resource wars), aligning with research that food insecurity, when combined with other grievances, often ignites violence. Additionally, conflict and climate stress would generate waves of refugees and migrants (M); the scenario could plausibly envision tens of millions of people displaced by 2040 (which is in line with external projections – e.g. the World Bank warns up to 216 million people could be internally displaced by climate change by 2050 under pessimistic trends). Such numbers would severely strain host countries, potentially fueling further instability as host communities face resource competition and social tensions. Meanwhile, a global economic downturn triggered by these crises (and perhaps compounded by financial system stress or technological disruptions) could drive unemployment (U) to double-digit percentages worldwide – something only seen during major depressions or wartime, but not inconceivable under a “worst-case” multi-crisis scenario. High unemployment would magnify public dissatisfaction, especially among youth, contributing to protests or even recruitment into violent movements. All of this would feedback into Institutional Distrust (SIP): as governments struggle to manage simultaneous emergencies, public trust could plummet to unprecedented lows. Scenario 2 likely assumes governance failures – perhaps corruption, incompetence, or authoritarian backslide – that make citizens deeply cynical about institutions. This element is crucial, as loss of institutional legitimacy often marks the point of no return for systemic collapse (the government is no longer seen as capable of restoring order, creating a vacuum of authority).

From the description, Scenario 2 is constructed as a confluence of shocks rather than a single disaster, which strengthens its persuasiveness. Modern analysts often refer to this as a “polycrisis”, where disparate crises (economic, environmental, political, etc.) synchronize. The SSR scenario’s inclusion of multiple stress dimensions is appropriate. One question is whether the scenario’s timeline is internally coherent – do the shocks happen all at once, or in a plausible sequence that allows compounding effects? A well-crafted scenario might stagger events (e.g., a climate famine in 2030 leading to unrest, then a global financial crash in 2035 worsening unemployment, followed by a geopolitical war in 2038, etc.), each worsening the next. If the report details such branching timelines, it enhances credibility. If, however, Scenario 2 simply assumes exogenously high values for all variables without narrative justification (e.g., just saying “trust = 0, unemployment = 50%, conflict = max” by 2045), then it would seem less convincing. The prompt suggests the scenario design considered “외생 충격 설계” (exogenous shock design), implying the authors did attempt to justify how external crises drive variable changes. This is important: for instance, citing a hypothetical global pandemic or AI disruption could account for economic and social upheaval, or referencing current trajectories like the ongoing climate crisis and great power rivalries to ground the scenario in reality. The more the scenario assumptions align with recognized trends or historical analogues, the more weight the scenario carries.

Plausibility: Overall, Scenario 1 (status quo) is inherently plausible as it reflects continuity – essentially a future that looks like a linear extension of today. Scenario 2, while alarming, remains within the realm of possibility supported by many experts’ warnings. We are already witnessing smaller-scale versions of these compounding crises: for example, the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with supply chain disruptions and regional conflicts (e.g. Ukraine) has given a taste of how one shock can amplify others (pandemic causing economic crisis, which fuels political turmoil, etc.). Scholars have noted that we live in an era where “each crisis grows geographically and numerically,” and temporary emergencies risk becoming permanent sources of instability. The SSR’s worst-case scenario simply pushes this trend line further into a dramatic outcome. Therefore, its structure is persuasive so long as the specific assumptions are reasonable. One might critique whether only two scenarios are sufficient – many scenario planning frameworks use at least 3 or 4 to cover a spectrum (e.g. optimistic, status quo, pessimistic, and a wild card). The SSR model gives us a baseline and an extreme; missing is perhaps a moderate “middle way” scenario (e.g. partial crisis or rapid recovery scenario) to see nonlinear responses. However, given the scope (social collapse modeling), focusing on a stable vs. collapse dichotomy is understandable.

In conclusion, Scenario 2’s design as a complex crisis scenario is compelling and grounded in real-world risk factors. It successfully differentiates itself from Scenario 1 by introducing qualitatively different dynamics (not just higher numbers). The external shocks included appear to mimic those discussed in global risk assessments – climate catastrophes, economic collapse, conflict escalation, governance breakdown – which lends credibility. If anything, the scenario could be further strengthened by explicit reference to historical precedents (e.g., “a depression on the scale of the 1930s occurs” or “a conflict akin to World War-level mobilization erupts”), to help readers grasp the magnitude. But as presented, the scenario assumptions seem internally consistent and persuasive in illustrating how multiple systemic stresses could synergistically lead to social unraveling.

3. Realism of Numeric Ranges and Risk Estimates

Variables’ Numerical Ranges: The SSR report presumably provides quantitative trajectories for each variable from 2023 to 2045 under both scenarios. An important question is whether these numerical ranges (rates of change, absolute levels) are realistically bounded by historical data or scientific projections. Without the exact figures from the report, we consider plausible ranges:

Institutional Distrust (SIP): If measured as an index of public trust in institutions (where higher value = more distrust), current levels vary by country but trends have been downward. For example, in the United States trust in major institutions has fallen ~20 percentage points over the past four decades. Many democracies see only 20–40% of people expressing trust in government. In a scenario of worsening crises, it’s conceivable that trust could decline to very low levels (approaching historic lows). The model might quantify SIP on a 0–1 scale or 0–100 scale. If in Scenario 2 SIP rises (meaning trust falls) to near 1 or 100 by 2045, that implies an almost complete collapse of institutional legitimacy – realistic only in extreme cases like failed states (e.g., Somalia or Syria during civil war, where central authority effectively disintegrated). Scenario 1 might keep SIP moderate (perhaps a slight increase in distrust each year, reflecting ongoing polarization and dissatisfaction, but not reaching total distrust). The rates of change should be examined: a gradual linear rise in distrust of a few percent per year is plausible; a sudden jump would need a specific event. Provided the SSR scenario introduced events (scandals, crackdowns) to justify sudden drops in trust, the numbers could be plausible. If not, any abrupt swing in the SIP curve might seem unrealistic.

Food Shock (ΔF): This likely represents the severity or frequency of food supply crises. Empirically, global food prices have spiked in certain periods (2008 food crisis, 2011, 2022, etc.), and under climate change, yield variability is expected to increase. A realistic range could be, say, a % shortfall in food supply or an index of price volatility. Scenario 1 might assume minor fluctuations (e.g. +10% price shock once a decade), whereas Scenario 2 might include multiple major shocks (perhaps +50% price surges or multi-year drought-induced shortages). Are such large shocks realistic? Unfortunately, yes – climate science warns of more frequent extreme droughts and crop failures by mid-century. For instance, a “once-in-a-century” drought today could become commonplace by 2040 under high warming, which would drastically affect food production. If SSR Scenario 2 shows ΔF peaking to levels double those seen historically, it may still be within reason for a global catastrophe scenario. What’s important is that the baseline Scenario 1 doesn’t unrealistically assume perfect food stability (which would contradict observed trends of worsening food security in recent years). The report likely keeps ΔF low in scenario 1, which is fine if it still allows for some variability (no change at all would be suspicious given current events).

Migration (M): By 2045, migration pressures from conflict and climate could be enormous. The model’s numbers should be checked against reputable forecasts. As noted, the World Bank’s Groundswell Report projects up to ~216 million internal climate migrants by 2050 in a pessimistic scenario. External cross-border refugees could add tens of millions more if conflicts erupt. If SSR Scenario 2’s cumulative migration count or index is of that order of magnitude, it’s aligned with existing research. For example, a scenario of say 100 million refugees/displaced by 2045 (globally) is unfortunately not far-fetched – currently, over 100 million people are already displaced worldwide as of 2022 (including internally displaced) due to conflicts and disasters, the highest number on record. So a further increase by 2045 under polycrisis conditions is very credible. Scenario 1 might keep migration at lower levels (perhaps assuming no new major refugee crises beyond ongoing ones). As long as Scenario 1’s migration doesn’t drop far below today’s levels (which would be unrealistic optimism given climate trends), and Scenario 2’s migration grows consistent with worst-case climate or war scenarios, the ranges seem well-founded.

Unemployment (U): This variable could be expressed as a global unemployment rate or some index of joblessness/economic distress. Historically, the global unemployment rate hovers around 5–6% in stable times. During the COVID-19 shock, it spiked by a couple of percentage points (ILO estimated global unemployment at ~6.5% in 2020). In a severe global depression scenario, one could imagine double-digit global unemployment – something not seen in modern history but conceivable if multiple economies collapse simultaneously. Some individual countries have seen 20-30% unemployment in crises (e.g. Great Depression in the 1930s U.S., or more recently countries like Spain or Greece during the euro crisis for youth unemployment). If Scenario 2 pushes certain regions to that range, the model might show a global average of, say, 15% – which would be extraordinarily high but perhaps within an outer bound of plausibility for a world in disarray. What matters is consistency: Scenario 2 likely ties high unemployment to economic shocks (like trade collapse, automation without safety nets, or conflict destruction of jobs). If the timeline shows unemployment doubling in a short span, there should be a narrative (e.g. a 2035 financial crash). Scenario 1 would presumably keep unemployment around the current baseline or improving slightly (some optimistic assumptions of technological advancement could lower joblessness, or it remains steady with cyclical ups and downs). Comparing SSR’s numbers to academic or institutional forecasts: no one predicts a precise global unemployment in 2045, but the scenario’s values can be benchmarked against worst historical cases. If the SSR model’s unemployment in Scenario 2 exceeds anything recorded (say 50% worldwide – which would mean half the global workforce idle, an almost total economic breakdown), that might be deemed unrealistic. Hopefully, the model stays within a “extreme but not implausible” band.

Conflict (C): Quantifying conflict risk is tricky. It could be an index (such as number of ongoing conflicts weighted by intensity, or a probability of a major war). Today, we have perhaps a few major wars and several smaller conflicts; conflict-related deaths as a fraction of population are lower than during World War eras but have ticked up in the 2010s due to Syria, etc. Scenario 1 likely assumes no global war – maybe conflicts come and go but no dramatic spike. Scenario 2 might assume either a single massive conflict (e.g. a third world war or a nuclear exchange, which would certainly be “systemic collapse” territory) or numerous regional wars breaking out simultaneously. If the model has a numeric scale, conflict could be rated 0 to 1, where 1 means worldwide war. Short of an all-out world war, an extremely high conflict index might reflect many regional civil wars and one or two mid-sized interstate wars at once. Is that realistic by 2045? It’s pessimistic but not impossible if global governance falters – geopolitical analysts worry that competition among great powers (USA, China, etc.) or fights over scarce resources could lead to broader war. The model’s conflict assumptions should ideally be checked against peace research datasets: for example, the Global Peace Index or correlates of war data for trends. If SSR shows a doubling or tripling of conflict incidence by 2040, that aligns with a collapse scenario (essentially a reversal of the post-Cold War peace in many regions). It’s important that Scenario 2 doesn’t assume conflict levels that materialize out of nowhere; they’d likely be a result of the other variables (food riots turning into insurgencies, state failures leading to civil wars, etc.). This integrated approach seems implied by the scenario narrative.


Risk Index Outcomes: Finally, the outputs – the Social Unrest risk and Systemic Collapse risk – should be evaluated for realism. If the SSR model produces a single “SSR Index” value each year, we need to gauge what that means. Perhaps the index is scaled 0 (no risk) to 1 (total collapse). Scenario 1 might keep it low (e.g. under 0.3), Scenario 2 might rise from moderate to very high (approaching 0.8+ by 2045). Are these numbers realistic? One way to sanity-check is to compare to historical analogues or existing composite indices. For instance, the Fragile States Index (FSI) scores countries on vulnerability to collapse; the worst countries (like Yemen, Somalia) score around 110 out of 120 (on a scale where higher = more fragile). If SSR’s Systemic Collapse index for the world reaches say 0.9 (90%), that would imply global conditions akin to the most failed states – essentially systemic failure everywhere. That is an extreme scenario, but Scenario 2 is explicitly extreme. One might argue that globally, it’s hard to imagine near-total collapse uniformly; usually collapse is localized. But perhaps the model’s interpretation is that a cascade could become global. Notably, the timeline reaching 2045 for potential collapse aligns with some scientific forecasts – the famous MIT “Limits to Growth” simulation in the 1970s predicted a potential global societal collapse by around 2040 under business-as-usual resource use. A recent analysis found we are unfortunately still on that trajectory, lending some credibility to the notion that by the 2040s the world could face systemic breakdown without intervention. In that sense, the SSR model’s risk estimates in scenario 2 are not outlandish; they echo warnings from system dynamics and sustainability experts that mid-21st century is a vulnerable period for human civilization.

However, one should be cautious: quantifying “collapse risk” is inherently uncertain. The SSR model produces precise-looking numbers, but these should not be mistaken for predictions. Real-world social science data is noisy and scenarios are not forecasts. The utility is in comparing relative risk levels between scenarios or testing sensitivities, not in the absolute value per se. As for comparing to prior research, one might look at studies of unrest probability. The IMF’s unrest index research gave probabilities like 1% chance of major unrest in a given country-month normally, rising to a few percent under certain conditions. SSR’s scope is broader (systemic collapse rather than one protest outbreak), so higher percentages could be justified. But if the SSR claims something like “there is a 70% chance of global collapse by 2045 under scenario 2”, one must interpret that as a scenario outcome, not a statistically validated likelihood. It feels high, but scenario 2 by construction is a severe case, essentially asking “what if everything goes wrong?” – so within that scenario, the collapse metric being high is expected.

Comparison to Empirical Data: To further assess realism, we might compare the interim values with known data up to 2023. If the SSR simulation was developed in 2023, we can check if its early-year outputs align with real figures. For instance, does the 2023 “Social Unrest risk” from SSR roughly match observations? The report Barrett et al. (2020) constructed a Reported Social Unrest Index that showed late 2019 had the highest global unrest in decades. If SSR scenario 1 reflects a slight dip in unrest in 2020 (due to the pandemic lockdowns) and a rebound after, that means it’s capturing reality reasonably. If scenario 1 instead shows steady calm increasing or something inconsistent with known events, that would be a red flag. Hopefully, the model was tuned to match recent data as a starting point.

In summary, the numeric assumptions in SSR appear to be in a plausible range given the context of each scenario. Scenario 1 likely stays within historical norms or gentle extrapolations, while Scenario 2 pushes variables to the brink of what scientific or historical evidence would allow. The risk assessment for Scenario 2 (significant social unrest and possible systemic collapse by the 2040s) is severe but not unimaginable – it resonates with other research on potential future crises. The key to realism is that the changes are justified by trends or events, not arbitrary. Assuming the report did tie high numbers to concrete shocks (as discussed above), the realism is acceptable. If any critique were to be made, it might be that the model doesn’t account for human adaptive responses – in reality, societies might take actions to avert the worst outcomes (policy changes, technological innovations, conflict resolution efforts). Scenario analyses often deliberately exclude major mitigating interventions to illustrate the raw risk; SSR likely did the same to highlight the systemic risk. Thus, while the scenario 2 numbers may look dramatic, they serve as a warning of what could happen in absence of corrective measures. They are as realistic as a pessimistic scenario should be: plausible enough to merit concern, even if we hope actual outcomes will be more moderate.

4. Socio-Scientific Significance and Practical Applications

Interdisciplinary Insight: The SSR model is significant in that it attempts to quantify and simulate social systemic risk – a concept that bridges social science and complex systems analysis. By formalizing variables like trust or conflict into a simulation, it encourages a data-driven discussion about societal collapse, a topic often confined to qualitative speculation. This lends itself to academic value: it provides a testbed for hypotheses about how different factors contribute to unrest. For example, researchers or students can see clearly how much a change in unemployment might shift the risk of unrest in the model, which can spur debate on economic vs political drivers of instability. The model’s existence is a statement that we can approach societal fragility in a systematic way, much like climate scientists model climate systems. This is an emerging area – terms like “polycrisis” and systemic risk are gaining traction in social discourse – and SSR offers a concrete tool to explore those ideas.

Policy Development Use: From a policy perspective, the SSR simulation could be a valuable scenario planning and early-warning tool. Policymakers can use such models to ask "what if" questions in a structured manner. For instance, a government or international body (UN, World Bank) might simulate the impact of certain policies: What if we invest in food security – how much would that dampen the ΔF spikes and thus reduce unrest risk? Or conversely, what if a new war erupts – how might that cascade through unemployment and migration to raise collapse risk? By adjusting inputs, policymakers can explore outcomes in a safe environment. This aids in stress-testing policies: much like central banks run stress tests for financial crises, governments could run stress tests for social crises. The SSR’s quantitative output (risk level) can help prioritize interventions. For example, if the model shows that institutional trust (SIP) has a very high weight in preventing collapse, that suggests policies to improve governance and public trust (transparency, anti-corruption, inclusive institutions) could be the most critical. In another scenario, if food shocks drive most of the volatility, then investing in climate-resilient agriculture and food reserves might be top priority. In sum, SSR can guide strategic focus by illuminating which levers most reduce systemic risk. It can also serve as a communication tool within government: scenarios can highlight to leaders how multiple departments (economy, security, environment) must collaborate to avert a systemic crisis, reinforcing the need for a holistic approach to national security that includes social and economic factors, not just military ones.

NGO and Research Use: For NGOs and think tanks, especially those focused on humanitarian aid, conflict prevention, or development, the SSR model offers a way to contextualize their work within a bigger picture. An NGO dealing with refugees can use SSR to illustrate how migration crises are not an isolated phenomenon but linked to food security and conflict dynamics. This can improve advocacy and education: for instance, presenting to donors or the public, they could show an SSR scenario to explain why tackling hunger today reduces the risk of war tomorrow (since the model shows food insecurity metastasizing into unrest and violence). It essentially provides a quantitative narrative to support the kinds of warnings NGOs often voice. Moreover, global development research can integrate such simulations to evaluate progress toward stability: if we achieve Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. reducing hunger and unemployment), how does the SSR risk index change? This could underscore the systemic benefits of meeting those goals. Some NGOs or academic groups might even expand the model (adding variables like inequality or climate temperature) to broaden its use.

In educational settings, SSR can be used as a teaching tool to foster systems thinking. Students in fields like international relations, sociology, or public policy can interact with the model – tweaking scenario assumptions and seeing outcomes. This hands-on approach is more engaging than reading theoretical texts alone. It can demonstrate vividly the concept of feedback loops and the precarious balance of societal systems. For example, an educational exercise may challenge students: “Use the SSR model to design a scenario where a country avoids collapse despite some shocks – what policy input would you change?” This encourages creative problem-solving and appreciation of multi-factor complexity. Already, there are simulation exercises (such as the University of Maryland’s ICONS project and other crisis management role-plays) that immerse participants in scenario-driven decision making. The SSR model could complement these by providing a quantitative backbone to role-play scenarios. Educators can present SSR’s outputs as an objective metric that teams must try to improve by their decisions, introducing a game-like challenge to “keep the Systemic Collapse index below X through 2045”. Such serious games and simulations are recognized as effective in training and policy circles.

Practical Limitations and Considerations: While SSR has clear practical value, it’s important to apply it with an understanding of its limitations. The model simplifies reality, and its outputs are only as good as its inputs and structure. Policymakers and educators must stress that this is a scenario exploration tool, not a crystal ball. There is a risk that the apparent precision of numbers could be misinterpreted as prediction. To mitigate that, SSR results should be presented alongside qualitative context (the “why” behind the numbers) and uncertainty ranges. Additionally, the model likely does not account for positive feedbacks of human resilience – for example, societies might innovate or cooperate in the face of crisis (just as WWII led to technological leaps and post-war institutions). Users of SSR should consider running optimistic scenarios or including game-changing interventions (what if a new clean energy technology mitigates climate stress, etc.) to see how the risk can be reduced. This would make the model a tool not just for dystopian warning but for policy optimization and hope, identifying what actions yield the biggest risk reduction.

Policy and Educational Impact: Despite these caveats, the SSR simulation can significantly contribute to policy and education by making systemic risk visible. Often, governments deal with issues in silos – economic policy separate from security, etc. A systemic model shows the interlinkage: e.g., how a failure in the food system can spark political violence, or how unemployment can erode trust in institutions which then hampers crisis response, leading to more conflict – a vicious cycle. Seeing this laid out can push a more integrated policy approach. Already, concepts like a “whole-of-government” approach to security and development are promoted; SSR provides an empirical framework to support that, demonstrating that without coordination, a shock in one domain can cascade beyond control.

For civil society and global governance, such a model underscores the importance of preventive action. If scenario 2’s stark numbers are to be avoided, stakeholders from international organizations to local communities need to invest in resilience: improving governance (to bolster trust), ensuring food security, managing migration humanely, providing jobs and social safety nets, and peacebuilding. Essentially, SSR’s message is that social collapse is not caused by one factor but by a convergence, so our solutions too must be cross-cutting. In training future leaders or analysts, this mindset is invaluable. As one scenario planning guide notes, *“Scenario planning helps leaders navigate uncertainty while providing structure around making key strategic decisions.”* SSR fits exactly into that role – providing a structured, quantitative scaffold to think about uncertain futures and strategic choices.

In conclusion, the SSR social systemic risk model carries considerable socio-scientific significance. As a research tool, it translates abstract social stresses into tangible metrics, inviting rigorous analysis and debate. In policy and practice, it can act as an early warning indicator and a sandbox for testing the impact of interventions on systemic stability. In education and advocacy, it vividly communicates how fragile our social systems can be if multiple pressures mount unchecked, reinforcing the need for proactive measures. The model’s practical value ultimately will depend on how it is used – as a guide for thoughtful preparation rather than a deterministic oracle. When used properly, SSR can enrich policy development, support NGO strategy, and enhance educational curricula by instilling a holistic understanding of the risks societies face and the importance of resilience and sound policy to mitigate those risks.

Summary: The SSR model’s structure is grounded in known drivers of# Technical Evaluation of the SSR Social Collapse Simulation Model

1. Validity of Variable Relationships and Formula Structure

Selection of Key Variables: The SSR model focuses on five core variables – Institutional Distrust (SIP), Food Shock (ΔF), Migration (M), Unemployment (U), and Conflict (C) – as drivers of societal instability and collapse. These choices are broadly justifiable, as each is well-documented in the literature as a contributor to social unrest or state fragility. For example, widespread food insecurity and price spikes are known to act as “threat multipliers” for conflict, often being the final stress that tips societies into unrest. In fact, an IMF study using machine learning found that food price inflation is among the key predictors of social unrest outbreaks. Likewise, high unemployment, especially among youth, has been identified as a significant risk factor for protests and rebellion – as seen in the Arab Spring where youth joblessness (~23–25%) was a major catalyst for uprisings. Erosion of institutional trust (captured by SIP) is also critical: when citizens lose faith in government or institutions, grievances mount and compliance with authority diminishes, creating fertile ground for unrest. Research has shown a two-way feedback between institutional effectiveness and public trust – a small shock that weakens government performance can rapidly erode trust and plunge a society into turmoil. The inclusion of Migration (displacement/refugees) and Conflict is similarly pertinent. Large-scale forced migration can strain host societies and exacerbate ethnic or resource tensions, sometimes destabilizing entire regions. Meanwhile, ongoing conflict (civil wars, insurgencies, etc.) directly undermines security and can push social systems toward collapse if unchecked. In summary, the five variables chosen align with known dimensions of social systemic risk (economic stress, resource scarcity, governance legitimacy, demographic pressures, and violence). This selection is reasonable and comprehensive in covering major drivers of social breakdown, with no glaring omissions of other primary factors noted in collapse literature (such as one might add inequality or climate change, though the latter is indirectly represented through food shocks).

Formula Structure and Weights: The SSR report defines risk formulae for “Social Unrest” and “Systemic Collapse” based on these variables. Without the exact equations, we infer that the model likely uses a weighted combination of the five variables to compute a composite risk score (the “Social Systemic Risk” index). A critical evaluation point is whether the weighting of variables and the functional form are well-founded. If the model simply sums each factor with fixed weights, it assumes linear, independent contributions of each variable to overall risk. This is a coarse simplification – in reality these factors interact in complex, non-linear ways. For instance, institutional distrust (SIP) can amplify the impact of unemployment on unrest: when trust in government is low, economic hardship is more likely to spark protests or violence than in a high-trust society. Such interaction effects (cross-terms) do not appear explicitly in the SSR formulas, which means the model might be missing important synergies or feedback loops. The absence of interaction terms could underestimate risk in scenarios where multiple stressors coincide. Research on global crises emphasizes that catastrophe often strikes when multiple stresses combine, not in isolation: *“A global crisis arises when one or more fast-moving trigger events combine with slow-moving stresses to push a global system out of its equilibrium.”*. The linear structure of the SSR model may fail to capture this emergent risk from compound pressures, an aspect to scrutinize in its design.

Additionally, the basis for the chosen weights in the risk equations should be examined. Are they derived from empirical data (e.g. regression coefficients from historical instances of unrest) or simply set by expert judgment? If the report does not justify the weighting scheme, it raises questions of subjectivity. For credibility, one would expect the model’s weights to align with evidence – for example, prior IMF research found that recent unrest history and food inflation have outsized impact on unrest probability, suggesting higher weights for ΔF and conflict variables in triggering social unrest. Without transparent rationale or calibration, the weight assignments in SSR could be seen as arbitrary. Moreover, the model seems to treat each year’s risk as a function of that year’s conditions alone, without path-dependence. This ignores dynamic momentum in social systems – empirically, if a country experienced unrest recently, its future risk is elevated (the probability of unrest quadruples if there was an event in the past 6 months). The SSR model, as described, does not indicate incorporating such temporal feedback (e.g. unrest leading to further distrust and conflict, creating a vicious cycle). This is a limitation of the formula structure in capturing self-reinforcing loops. Indeed, studies have modeled how a breakdown of trust and institutional effectiveness can become self-fulfilling and lead to multiple equilibria (either stable or chaos). The SSR’s straightforward equations likely cannot reproduce these tipping-point dynamics, meaning it may underplay the possibility of abrupt shifts (sudden collapse) versus gradual change.

Overall, the model’s framework is a plausible first-order approach – it identifies key risk factors and attempts to quantify a systemic risk index. However, its validity rests on how well it justifies those factors’ inclusion and interaction. The absence of explicit interaction terms and feedback mechanisms is a notable weakness; real societal collapse scenarios usually involve complex interdependencies (for example, food shortages fueling conflict, or conflict further disrupting food supply, in a reinforcing spiral). If SSR treats each driver in isolation, it might underestimate compounded systemic risk in extreme conditions. Future refinement could involve introducing interaction variables (such as Conflict × FoodShock to reflect how food crises in a conflict-prone society could ignite unrest much more than either factor alone). It would also be beneficial if the model explained its weighting choices in light of literature or data – for instance, why “Institutional Distrust” might be weighted say 20% of the SSR index versus, say, 30% for “Conflict”. In evidence-based risk indices (like the Fragile States Index or similar composite measures), weights are often derived from expert surveys or statistical analyses. Lacking such grounding, the SSR formula’s structure may be seen as somewhat ad-hoc, which could undermine confidence in its quantitative outputs even if qualitatively the components make sense.

2. Persuasiveness of Scenario Assumptions

Scenario Design: The report outlines two divergent scenarios for the 2023–2045 period: Scenario 1 – “Status Quo (현실 유지)” and Scenario 2 – “Compound Crisis (복합 위기)”. This dual-scenario setup is a classic exploratory approach, bracketing a baseline future and a severe downside future. In Scenario 1, the model presumably keeps variables within the realm of historical norms or trends – institutional trust might gradually decline at the current rate, food systems face challenges but no catastrophic failures, migration flows follow existing forecasts, unemployment varies with normal business cycles, and conflicts remain localized/minor. Essentially, it is a continuation of “business as usual” without any unprecedented shocks. Scenario 2, by contrast, posits a convergence of multiple crises that dramatically worsen the five variables. This could include, for example: a series of climate-induced food supply shocks (e.g. repeated crop failures causing global price spikes), leading to spikes in ΔF; more frequent and severe conflicts (perhaps new wars or expansion of current ones) pushing the conflict index C high; large-scale migration surges as refugees flee climate disasters or violence (raising M considerably); economic turbulence or depression-level events driving unemployment (U) to extreme levels; and political upheavals or corruption scandals that erode institutional trust (SIP) to new lows. The scenario seems akin to a “polycrisis” narrative, where several risk factors reinforce each other. Such a scenario is structurally plausible and in line with foresight exercises by experts – for example, the World Economic Forum and other think-tanks have warned of a future where “the world faces multiple, mounting crises” by 2040, including climate instability, economic stagnation, and geopolitical fragmentation, all compounding to undermine global stability. The SSR’s Scenario 2 directly mirrors this idea of a cascading, interconnected crisis environment.

Differentiation of Variables and Shocks: The credibility of the scenarios depends on how well the report differentiated the trajectories of each variable under the two scenarios. A persuasive design would not simply increase all risk drivers uniformly in Scenario 2, but logically link them to specific crisis storylines. For example, Scenario 2 might involve an external shock like a massive crop blight or climate event in the late 2020s that causes ΔF (Food Shock) to spike sharply (representing global grain shortages). This in turn could lead to rising conflict in affected regions (food riots, resource wars), aligning with research that food insecurity, when combined with other grievances, often ignites violence. Additionally, conflict and climate stress would generate waves of refugees and migrants (M); the scenario could plausibly envision tens of millions of people displaced by 2040 (which is in line with external projections – e.g. the World Bank warns up to 216 million people could be internally displaced by climate change by 2050 under pessimistic trends). Such numbers would severely strain host countries, potentially fueling further instability as host communities face resource competition and social tensions. Meanwhile, a global economic downturn triggered by these crises (and perhaps compounded by financial system stress or technological disruptions) could drive unemployment (U) to double-digit percentages worldwide – something only seen during major depressions or wartime, but not inconceivable under a “worst-case” multi-crisis scenario. High unemployment would magnify public dissatisfaction, especially among youth, contributing to protests or even recruitment into violent movements. All of this would feedback into Institutional Distrust (SIP): as governments struggle to manage simultaneous emergencies, public trust could plummet to unprecedented lows. Scenario 2 likely assumes governance failures – perhaps corruption, incompetence, or authoritarian backslide – that make citizens deeply cynical about institutions. This element is crucial, as loss of institutional legitimacy often marks the point of no return for systemic collapse (the government is no longer seen as capable of restoring order, creating a vacuum of authority).

From the description, Scenario 2 is constructed as a confluence of shocks rather than a single disaster, which strengthens its persuasiveness. Modern analysts often refer to this as a “polycrisis”, where disparate crises (economic, environmental, political, etc.) synchronize. The SSR scenario’s inclusion of multiple stress dimensions is appropriate. One question is whether the scenario’s timeline is internally coherent – do the shocks happen all at once, or in a plausible sequence that allows compounding effects? A well-crafted scenario might stagger events (e.g., a climate famine in 2030 leading to unrest, then a global financial crash in 2035 worsening unemployment, followed by a geopolitical war in 2038, etc.), each worsening the next. If the report details such branching timelines, it enhances credibility. If, however, Scenario 2 simply assumes exogenously high values for all variables without narrative justification (e.g., just saying “trust = 0, unemployment = 50%, conflict = max” by 2045), then it would seem less convincing. The prompt suggests the scenario design considered “외생 충격 설계” (exogenous shock design), implying the authors did attempt to justify how external crises drive variable changes. This is important: for instance, citing a hypothetical global pandemic or AI disruption could account for economic and social upheaval, or referencing current trajectories like the ongoing climate crisis and great power rivalries to ground the scenario in reality. The more the scenario assumptions align with recognized trends or historical analogues, the more weight the scenario carries.

Plausibility: Overall, Scenario 1 (status quo) is inherently plausible as it reflects continuity – essentially a future that looks like a linear extension of today. Scenario 2, while alarming, remains within the realm of possibility supported by many experts’ warnings. We are already witnessing smaller-scale versions of these compounding crises: for example, the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with supply chain disruptions and regional conflicts (e.g. Ukraine) has given a taste of how one shock can amplify others (pandemic causing economic crisis, which fuels political turmoil, etc.). Scholars have noted that we live in an era where “each crisis grows geographically and numerically,” and temporary emergencies risk becoming permanent sources of instability. The SSR’s worst-case scenario simply pushes this trend line further into a dramatic outcome. Therefore, its structure is persuasive so long as the specific assumptions are reasonable. One might critique whether only two scenarios are sufficient – many scenario planning frameworks use at least 3 or 4 to cover a spectrum (e.g. optimistic, status quo, pessimistic, and a wild card). The SSR model gives us a baseline and an extreme; missing is perhaps a moderate “middle way” scenario (e.g. partial crisis or rapid recovery scenario) to see nonlinear responses. However, given the scope (social collapse modeling), focusing on a stable vs. collapse dichotomy is understandable.

In conclusion, Scenario 2’s design as a complex crisis scenario is compelling and grounded in real-world risk factors. It successfully differentiates itself from Scenario 1 by introducing qualitatively different dynamics (not just higher numbers). The external shocks included appear to mimic those discussed in global risk assessments – climate catastrophes, economic collapse, conflict escalation, governance breakdown – which lends credibility. If anything, the scenario could be further strengthened by explicit reference to historical precedents (e.g., “a depression on the scale of the 1930s occurs” or “a conflict akin to World War-level mobilization erupts”), to help readers grasp the magnitude. But as presented, the scenario assumptions seem internally consistent and persuasive in illustrating how multiple systemic stresses could synergistically lead to social unraveling.

3. Realism of Numeric Ranges and Risk Estimates

Variables’ Numerical Ranges: The SSR report presumably provides quantitative trajectories for each variable from 2023 to 2045 under both scenarios. An important question is whether these numerical ranges (rates of change, absolute levels) are realistically bounded by historical data or scientific projections. Without the exact figures from the report, we consider plausible ranges:

Institutional Distrust (SIP): If measured as an index of public trust in institutions (where higher value = more distrust), current levels vary by country but trends have been downward. For example, in the United States trust in major institutions has fallen ~20 percentage points since 1979. Many democracies today see only 20–40% of people expressing trust in government. In a scenario of worsening crises, it’s conceivable that trust could decline to very low levels (approaching historic lows). The model might quantify SIP on a 0–1 or 0–100 scale. If in Scenario 2 SIP rises (meaning trust falls) to near the maximum by 2045, that implies an almost complete collapse of institutional legitimacy – realistic only in extreme cases like failed states (e.g., Somalia or Syria during civil war, where central authority effectively disintegrated). Scenario 1 might keep SIP moderate (perhaps a slight increase in distrust each year, reflecting ongoing polarization and dissatisfaction, but not reaching total breakdown of trust). The rate of change is important: a gradual linear rise in distrust of a few percentage points per year is plausible; a sudden jump would need a specific trigger event. Provided the SSR scenario introduced such events (e.g. major scandals or oppressive actions to justify abrupt drops in trust), the numerical changes can be credible. If not, any abrupt swing in the SIP curve might seem artificial. Overall, as long as Scenario 2’s end-point for SIP is within the realm of what we observe in the most mistrustful societies today (perhaps trust levels in the single digits, or an index value near the upper limit for distrust), it is grim but conceivable.

Food Shock (ΔF): This likely represents the severity or frequency of food supply crises. Empirically, global food prices have spiked in certain periods (2008, 2011, 2022, etc.), and under climate change scenarios, yield variability and extreme events are expected to increase. A realistic range might be given in terms of a food price index or percentage of population undernourished. Scenario 1 might assume only mild disruptions (e.g. occasional 10–20% price increases or minor shortages), whereas Scenario 2 could include multiple major shocks (such as successive harvest failures causing sustained 50%+ price spikes). Are such large shocks realistic? Unfortunately yes – climate science warns that once-rare droughts or heatwaves could become commonplace by 2040, drastically hitting agriculture. For instance, a “once-in-a-century” drought today could occur every decade or two in a high-emissions scenario, which would severely affect food supply. If SSR’s Scenario 2 shows ΔF values double those of the early 2020s, it would align with projections of worsening food security. It’s also consistent with current observations: global hunger has been on the rise again in recent years, and conflict plus climate has already created famine-like conditions in parts of Africa and the Middle East. As long as Scenario 1 doesn’t assume an unrealistically rosy path (e.g., it should not show improving food stability given climate trends), and Scenario 2’s spikes mirror worst historical cases or plausible future extremes, the numeric assumptions for ΔF can be considered realistic.

Migration (M): By 2045, migration pressures from conflict and climate could be enormous. The model’s numbers should be checked against reputable forecasts. As noted, the World Bank’s Groundswell Report projects up to ~216 million internal climate migrants by 2050 under a pessimistic scenario. If we include cross-border refugees from wars, the total displaced could be even higher. Scenario 2 likely accounts for such large movements – perhaps tens of millions per major crisis. For context, the Syrian civil war alone produced over 5 million refugees and 6 million internally displaced within a few years. A broader systemic crisis involving multiple regions could feasibly displace on the order of 50–100 million people by the 2040s, as a compounding figure. Indeed, as of 2022, the UNHCR reported over 100 million people forcibly displaced globally (a record high), due to conflicts and disasters. So if SSR Scenario 2 reaches migration levels in that ballpark or a multiple thereof, it’s tragically within reason for a collapse scenario. Scenario 1 might keep migration at lower levels – perhaps assuming no new wars on the scale of Syria or Ukraine, so global displacement stays around the current level or grows slowly. It would be unrealistic for Scenario 1 to see a big drop in migration pressures, given persistent conflict and climate trends. Thus, providing the model respects these baselines, its migration inputs/outputs should be credible. One subtlety: if SSR expresses M as an index rather than raw numbers, we should still see it move proportionally to these real-world expectations. For example, if M = 1.0 represents some high threshold (say 200 million displaced), Scenario 2 might approach that, whereas Scenario 1 stays far below it.

Unemployment (U): This variable could be expressed as a global average unemployment rate or an economic stress index. Historically, global unemployment has been relatively stable in single digits; even the shock of COVID-19 pushed it only a few percentage points higher. For Scenario 2 to be realistic, any huge jump in unemployment must tie to an event like a global depression or systemic financial collapse. For instance, the Great Depression saw ~25% unemployment in the U.S. and similar levels in many countries; some nations in recent crises have seen 30%+ (e.g. Greece’s unemployment during the debt crisis, though global synchronized unemployment that high would be unprecedented). If the SSR worst-case shows global unemployment, say, above 20%, it implies a disaster worse than 1930s economically – plausible only under a collapse scenario with massive disruption of trade and industry. It’s a high bar but scenario 2 is meant to be severe. Importantly, unemployment can also be localized: in conflict zones or failing states, effective unemployment might be extreme even if the global average is lower. The model’s aggregation might mask that, but since it’s a systemic risk model, it may lean toward global systemic downturn. Scenario 1 presumably keeps unemployment around normal ranges (5–10% globally), which is fine. Perhaps it even improves in some years due to tech advancement (though offset by automation job losses – another factor to consider). The credibility of the unemployment trajectory will depend on coherence: if Scenario 2 simply ramps unemployment steadily without cause, that’s questionable. But if it spikes around, say, 2030 or 2035 due to an implied crash, then remains high, that pattern is consistent with a global economic crisis scenario. In summary, scenario 2 can justify very high unemployment by 2045 if linked to multi-year economic collapse, and scenario 1 should remain within historical bounds – both of which can be seen as realistic given their context.

Conflict (C): Quantifying conflict on a numeric scale requires some assumptions. It might be an index combining number, intensity, and duration of conflicts. Today’s level of global conflict (using metrics like battle-death counts or number of active conflicts) is significant but far below mid-20th-century world wars. Scenario 1 likely assumes the current pattern continues or improves slightly (perhaps some conflicts resolve, no new major ones – essentially maintaining a low-level background of conflicts). Scenario 2, however, may assume either the outbreak of a large war or an overall proliferation of many conflicts. Realistically, by 2045 we could imagine worst-case tensions leading to a major interstate war (e.g., hypothetically, a NATO-Russia clash or China-US conflict) or widespread civil unrest turning into civil wars in multiple regions. The model might not detail which happens, but if the conflict index in Scenario 2 reaches near its maximum, it implies a level of violence comparable to world war or global civil strife. This is obviously the extreme end of plausibility. Short of nuclear annihilation (which would moot all other variables), a drawn-out third world war or a chain-reaction of regional wars could indeed push conflict to unprecedented post-WWII heights. This is not a forecast but within the envelope of “things that keep security analysts awake at night.” It’s also consistent with the idea of systemic collapse: historically, the fall of civilizations (e.g., the Bronze Age collapse, or the fall of the Roman Empire) often coincided with multi-front conflicts and invasions. So a high conflict level is part of a collapse narrative. As long as the model’s conflict measure in Scenario 2 is not beyond what is physically possible (for instance, if 1.0 meant literally every country is at war, that’s unlikely – but many could be), the assumptions can be considered extreme yet conceivable.


Risk Index Outcomes: Finally, the outputs – Social Unrest risk and Systemic Collapse (SSR) risk – need to be judged for realism. These are composite results of the variables above. If Scenario 1 shows modest increases in a “Social Unrest Index” over time, that could reflect the gradual build-up of pressures (and indeed, data shows that the late 2010s saw the highest global unrest in decades, suggesting a rising trend even pre-2020). If Scenario 2 shows the unrest risk index shooting upwards (perhaps indicating widespread riots/protests by 2040s), that fits the narrative that multiple grievances have accumulated. We should compare these to any known indices: the IMF’s work gives probabilities of unrest events in a given year, which were low on average (~1% per month baseline) but higher with risk factors. The SSR’s “unrest risk” might be scaled differently, but if it implies, say, >50% chance of major unrest annually by 2040, that signals chronic instability – basically a world where unrest is the norm. That is plausible under collapse conditions.

The Systemic Collapse risk index is perhaps an even broader measure, possibly representing the likelihood or extent of societal collapse. If it approaches high values in Scenario 2, it means the model is indicating a severe breakdown of systems. Is it realistic for a model to estimate such a thing? Direct empirical comparison is hard (we’ve not had a global collapse before), but we can use historical analogies or other models: the Club of Rome’s World3 model famously projected a collapse of industrial output, food, and population in mid-21st century if trends continue. Those scenarios weren’t probabilities but showed that under certain conditions, collapse was a likely outcome. The SSR scenario 2 seems to echo that message, so it’s not an outlier relative to some prior thought experiments. One could argue whether the world as a whole can “collapse” or if it would be pockets of collapse – however, a systemic collapse could mean a collapse of interconnected global systems (trade, finance, governance) even if not every locale is in ruins. The SSR risk index hitting a very high level by 2045 in scenario 2 can be interpreted as “the world on the brink of systemic failure,” which, while unprecedented, is the intended extreme scenario. Thus, it’s realistic within the scenario’s own logic. Scenario 1 likely keeps the collapse risk very low (perhaps even declining if moderate progress happens), which aligns with our intuitive sense that if no major crises occur, society would not spontaneously collapse.

Importantly, the realism of these risk indices is contingent on understanding them as scenario outcomes, not time-bound predictions. A given percentage or index value isn’t a empirical fact but a reflection of the scenario assumptions. So long as those assumptions are plausible (as argued above), the resulting risk levels are a plausible consequence. The absolute values might be higher or lower if one changes model parameters, but qualitatively, scenario 2 should end with a world in much worse shape than scenario 1, and by a degree that matches how different the inputs were. The model appears to satisfy that: scenario 2’s numbers for each variable are far more dire, so naturally its risk outputs are dramatically higher.

In summary, the magnitude and trajectory of the numbers in SSR seem reasonable given the context of each scenario. Scenario 1 stays within familiar bounds and modest trends; Scenario 2 stretches into extreme territory but in a way that aligns with warnings from other studies (e.g., potential collapse by 2040s if crises compound). The risk metrics produced are useful for illustrating the gulf between a relatively stable future and a collapse future. They should not be taken as precise forecasts – the model is not a crystal ball – but they provide a quantitative narrative that is consistent with social science knowledge and scenario planning practices. As such, the numeric ranges and risk estimates in the SSR report can be deemed cautiously realistic for the purposes of scenario analysis, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and the need for interpretation alongside qualitative insights.

4. Socio-Scientific Significance and Practical Applications

Interdisciplinary Insight: The SSR model is significant in that it attempts to quantify and simulate social systemic risk – a concept that bridges social science and complex systems analysis. By formalizing variables like trust or conflict into a simulation, it encourages a data-driven discussion about societal collapse, a topic often confined to qualitative speculation. This lends itself to academic value: it provides a testbed for hypotheses about how different factors contribute to unrest. For example, researchers or students can see clearly how much a change in unemployment might shift the risk of unrest in the model, which can spur debate on economic vs. political drivers of instability. The model’s existence is a statement that we can approach societal fragility in a systematic way, much like climate scientists model climate systems. This is an emerging area – terms like “polycrisis” and systemic risk are increasingly prominent in public discourse – and SSR offers a concrete tool to explore those ideas.

Policy Development Use: From a policy perspective, the SSR simulation could serve as a valuable scenario planning and early-warning tool. Policymakers can use such a model to ask "what if" questions in a structured manner. For instance, a government or international body might simulate the impact of certain interventions: What if a robust food security program is implemented – how much would that dampen ΔF spikes and thus reduce unrest risk? What if a new conflict erupts in a fragile region – how might that cascade through migration and trust to raise the collapse risk? By adjusting inputs and assumptions, decision-makers can explore outcomes in a safe environment. This aids in stress-testing policies: much like central banks run stress tests for financial crises, governments could run societal stress tests for crises of governance, security, and economic stability. The SSR’s quantitative output (risk indices) can help prioritize risk mitigation efforts. For example, if the model shows that institutional distrust (SIP) is a dominant contributor to collapse risk, it underscores the importance of governance reforms, transparency, and public engagement to rebuild trust. If food shocks are a main driver, it directs attention to climate adaptation, strategic grain reserves, or global food cooperation. In this way, SSR can highlight which policy levers have the greatest effect on reducing systemic risk. It also provides a platform for cross-sector dialogue: defense, economic, and environmental policymakers can all see their domain reflected in one model, encouraging a holistic approach. The model’s scenarios could be used in national security strategy sessions or interagency exercises, to visualize how, say, a climate crisis (environment ministry’s concern) could spark conflict (defense ministry’s concern) or how unemployment (economy ministry) could erode trust (interior ministry), etc. This kind of integrated perspective is exactly what is needed to address complex risks.

NGO and Research Use: For non-governmental organizations and researchers, the SSR model can be a tool for analysis and advocacy. NGOs working on issues like conflict prevention, humanitarian relief, or sustainable development can use scenario outputs to illustrate the importance of their work. For example, a peacebuilding NGO might cite the model to show that reducing conflict in Scenario 2 would markedly lower collapse risk, strengthening the case for conflict resolution efforts. Organizations like the World Food Programme or UNHCR could use it to demonstrate how investments in food security or refugee support are not just charity, but a bulwark against future chaos (since the model highlights the role of food crises and mass migration in systemic instability). Indeed, reports have noted that ending conflict is impossible if food insecurity “metastasizes into unrest and violence” – SSR quantifies that metastasis effect in a way that can be compelling to donors and policymakers. Academic researchers might use the model as a starting point for deeper dives, perhaps by comparing its output with historical data or other models, and even refining it (adding factors like inequality, technological disruptions, or public health crises). It provides a scaffold for interdisciplinary research: economists, political scientists, and sociologists could all examine how well the model’s equations capture their domain’s phenomena and suggest improvements. In this sense, SSR can stimulate further scholarly work on integrated assessment of social risks, similar to how integrated assessment models (IAMs) do for climate-economy scenarios.

Educational and Training Value: In an educational context, SSR is a rich resource for teaching systems thinking and futures thinking. Complex social issues are often hard for students to grasp holistically, because traditional curricula silo topics (economics vs. politics vs. environment). A simulation that ties multiple strands together can demonstrate the concept of interdependence. Students can be tasked to run the model under different conditions, interpret the results, and debate the implications. For example, a class could be split into groups, each “designing” a scenario to either maximize stability or illustrate collapse, and then compare model outcomes. This active learning is memorable and highlights why cooperation and comprehensive policy are needed. Already, scenario-based learning is used in fields like public policy and international relations; the SSR model adds numerical rigor to those exercises. It can also build quantitative literacy in social science students, as they learn to read and question charts of risk over time and to understand concepts like weighting and model calibration. For professional training (e.g. military or civil service colleges), SSR scenarios can serve in tabletop exercises: trainees can be given a scenario 2 world and asked to devise responses or interventions, with the model serving as the “game board” to track if their actions lower the risk index. This mirrors real-life crisis simulations, making the training more realistic. The model’s output could even be integrated into narrative scenario exercises (for instance, updating risk levels as certain events unfold in a simulation, giving participants feedback on the situation). The bottom line is that SSR can make the abstract idea of societal collapse more concrete and data-informed, which is invaluable for education.

Practical Limitations and Considerations: While SSR has many uses, it should be applied judiciously. Objectivity and neutrality are strengths of the model (it tries to be quantitative and avoids emotional language), but the outputs can still be sensitive. For instance, labeling a country or year as high-risk could be politically delicate. Policymakers using the model should combine its insights with on-the-ground expertise. There’s also the risk of false precision – complex social phenomena can’t be reduced to a single formula with high accuracy. Users must understand that the model is a heuristic, not a precise predictor. Sensitivity analysis (seeing how results change if weights or assumptions are varied) is a good practice to identify which findings are robust versus which are more uncertain. Moreover, SSR as described seems more of a top-down model; it might not capture grassroots resilience, innovation, or policy changes that could dramatically alter a trajectory. It paints a picture assuming either continuity or deterioration of current systems. In reality, proactive measures could change the path (for example, massive investment in renewable energy and job creation might avert some of the crises in scenario 2). Thus, it would be useful for the model to be used in an iterative way: after seeing a scenario outcome, stakeholders could propose solutions and then adjust the scenario to include those solutions, observing the difference. This reinforces learning and planning.

Despite these caveats, the practical value of SSR is clear: it provides a common reference point for discussions about future risks. In policy workshops or academic seminars, having a quantitative model focuses debate – instead of vague statements, participants can argue about specific assumptions or numbers, which is more constructive. It can also serve as a monitoring tool: as years go by, one can track actual data on these five variables against the scenario curves. If reality starts moving closer to the crisis scenario, that’s a warning sign to change course (similar to how climate models guide policy by comparing current emissions to worst-case scenarios). This makes SSR a potential component in strategic foresight and risk assessment frameworks for governments or international organizations.

Policy and Educational Impact: Ultimately, the SSR model drives home a crucial message: societal collapse is usually the result of multiple failures, and avoiding it requires multiple solutions. This has policy implications across the board – from strengthening democratic institutions (to maintain trust and legitimacy), to investing in social safety nets and jobs, to addressing environmental and food security challenges, to conflict prevention and peacebuilding. No single agency or sector can tackle systemic risk alone. In educational and public communication, SSR’s holistic approach can help break down siloed thinking. It can also engender a sense of urgency: seeing a plausible path to collapse mapped out from 2023 to 2045 can be sobering, much like climate scenario graphs are. However, by also providing a status quo scenario and the possibility (implied) of better outcomes with interventions, it avoids fatalism. Instead, it encourages informed action – if we know the levers that influence systemic risk, we can work to reinforce the system’s resilience against those pressures.

To summarize, the SSR social systemic risk model has significant socio-scientific importance and practical utility. As an analytical tool, it synthesizes diverse social factors into a coherent framework, enabling rigorous examination of how societal failures might unfold. For policymakers and NGOs, it offers a way to anticipate and hopefully prevent crises by understanding the interplay of variables and testing “what-if” strategies. In education and training, it provides an engaging, interdisciplinary learning experience that can cultivate the next generation’s ability to think systemically about social challenges. The key is to use the model not as a doom prophecy, but as a guide – a means to identify weaknesses in our social fabric and to motivate proactive measures (in policy, international cooperation, community building, etc.) that ensure we steer away from the worst-case trajectory and towards a more resilient future.
