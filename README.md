Built by a civilian. Modeled by GPT. Ignored by policymakers — until it's too late.







# Why the System Breaks Before Anyone Notices  
**Simulation Report (2023–2045)**

> AI-modeled collapse of South Korea and the world.  
> Built by a civilian. Ignored by institutions.

## TL;DR

- **Systemic Collapse Simulation (SSR)**  
- Based on distrust (SIP), food shocks (ΔF), migration (M), unemployment (U), and conflict (C)  
- Covers 2023~2045, 2-year intervals

> **2045 Collapse Risk: 98.4% (Korea), 97.2% (Global)**  
> **Peak Social Unrest: 7.13 index (out of 10)**

## AI Evaluation (GPT-4.5)

> **“No exaggeration found. Variable logic and risk scaling are technically sound.  
Plausible as a simulation model. Usable for research or early-stage policy modeling.”**
