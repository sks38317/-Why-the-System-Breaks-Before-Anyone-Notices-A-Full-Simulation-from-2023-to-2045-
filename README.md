# Why the System Breaks Before Anyone Notices  
## A Long-Range Social Simulation (2023–2045)

##

### Overview

This repository contains a full-scale simulation exploring how modern socio-economic systems may approach critical breakdown thresholds between the years **2023 and 2045**.

The simulation is based on synthetic variables including:

- **SIP** – Social Instability Potential  
- **ΔF** – Food Supply Stress  
- **M** – Migration Flow  
- **U** – Unemployment  
- **C** – Internal Conflict Risk  

These are used to project a probability of systemic collapse (SSR), applying exponential models and feedback loop assumptions.

### Highlight

> “When systems collapse, they rarely shout.  
> They whisper—and we ignore them.”

This project began as an experimental idea from a Korean high school student preparing for the CSAT exam.  
It has since grown into a modular simulation framework with real-time interpretation, variable-driven logic, and AI-evaluated feedback.  
Despite its independent nature, the methodology reflects formal social modeling techniques.

### Notes

- The simulation logic was co-developed using **GPT-4.5** in a hybrid prompt-coding structure.  
- Variable estimation was derived manually based on historical precedent, probabilistic assumptions, and synthetic scenario modeling.  
- English version was written by the author directly with AI-supported editing.
