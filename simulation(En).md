## 1. Purpose of the Report

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of a structural social collapse simulation (Social Systemic Risk Simulation, SSR) designed using a GPT-based system. The report integrates the overall structure, background, scenario classifications, variable frameworks, numerical modeling, and system responsiveness.

The objectives of the report are as follows:  
- To provide realistic, risk-based scenarios  
- To initiate public and expert-level discourse  
- To archive the results of boundary tests on AI predictive systems

## 2. Overview of the Simulation

- **Simulation name**: Simulation_SSR_KRvsWorld  
- **Scope**: Republic of Korea, global average  
- **Time frame**: 2023–2045 (biennial intervals)  
- **Structure**: Numerical model based on variables + risk accumulation based on scenario divergence

### 2.1 Definition of Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Maintaining Current Standards
- **Baseline**: Conditions from 2023–2024 remain constant  
- **Characteristics**: Gradual deterioration / residual controllability / accumulating structural fatigue

#### Scenario 2: Complex Crisis Assumption
- **Baseline**: Simulated complex shocks introduced from 2025–2045  
- **Characteristics**: Simulation of simultaneous crises involving food, climate, politics, migration, technology, and information

#### 2.1.1 Summary of Variable Value Differences by Scenario

| Variable | Scenario 1     | Scenario 2      | Basis for Gap Settings                   |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| SIP      | Linear increase | Early acceleration | Differences in trust threshold        |
| ΔF       | +0.1/2 years    | +0.2~0.3/2 years | WFP food insecurity index models       |
| M        | +1.0 (20 years) | ≥+1.2            | Climate/refugee inflow forecasts       |
| U        | Uniform increase | Non-linear acceleration | IMF multi-crisis simulations     |
| C        | Stable increase | Peaks present     | Trends in conflict frequency and organization |

## 3. Definitions of Variables and Formula Structure

| Variable                   | Code | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| System distrust            | SIP  | Decline in trust in government and societal systems          |
| Food insecurity shock      | ΔF   | Instability in food supply due to climate and supply chains  |
| Migration                  | M    | Large-scale domestic and international migration             |
| Unemployment               | U    | Employment collapses and structural unemployment             |
| Conflict (political/social)| C    | Political and social strife, crime, and internal clashes     |

### 3.1 Risk Formula

```
SSR(t) = 0.5·SIP + 1.5·|ΔF| + 0.8·M + 0.6·U + 1.0·C  
Social Unrest(t) = SSR(t) × 0.8  
Systemic Collapse(t) = max(0, SSR(t) − 0.5) × 1.2
```

This formula reflects the strength of risks for each variable and their interactions, calculating cumulative risks over time in a time-series manner.

### 3.1.1 Explanation of Unrest and Collapse Rate Metrics

| Metric       | Unrest Rate                      | Collapse Rate                               |
|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Focus        | Social atmosphere, public reactions | Capacity of systemic governance and continuity |
| Formula      | SSR × 0.8                        | max(0, SSR − 0.5) × 1.2                      |
| Phenomena    | Protests, increased violence     | Government paralysis, supply disruptions     |

---

### 3.2 Rationale and Flexibility of Formulas

- This model quantifies five key factors that constitute structural risks through weighted aggregation.  
- Coefficients (weights) are determined based on the contribution of each factor to social collapse, supported by empirical literature and system simulations.  
- ΔF is given a high weight due to the cascading impact of food insecurity on multiple risk domains.  
- The formula is designed as a flexible experimental model, allowing users to adjust coefficients based on analysis goals.  
- Depending on specific national or regional contexts, weights such as SIP or C can be adjusted. This can also be modified when introducing policy intervention variables.

## 4. Time-Series Risk Analysis Results (Based on Scenario 2)

### 4.1 Risk Computation over Time

```
SSR(t) = 0.5·SIP + 1.5·|ΔF| + 0.8·M + 0.6·U + 1.0·C  
Social Unrest(t) = SSR(t) × 0.8  
Systemic Collapse(t) = max(0, SSR(t) − 0.5) × 1.2
```

This formula reflects the cumulative risk development across time based on variable intensities and their interactions.

### Recommendations for Improvement

- **Non-linear Variable Response**: Apply threshold amplification (e.g., if ΔF > 1.0, surge impact on SIP/C).  
- **Cross-variable Interaction Terms**: Include composite metrics (e.g., M×C, SIP×U).  
- **Collapse Threshold Weighting**: When SSR > 6.0, apply multiplier for rapid systemic failure.
